## Goal
This is a demo app to teach how to implement an order card with features to increase/decrease and add or remove an item to an order in Ruby on Rails (AJAXIFIED).

This demo was created from [this other one](https://github.com/andrerferrer/order-card-demo#goal).

[You can also check my other demos](https://github.com/andrerferrer/dedemos/blob/master/README.md#ded%C3%A9mos).
